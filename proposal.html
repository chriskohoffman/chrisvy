			<h1>Italy / 2018</h1>

			<p class="bodytext">It was a crisp Spring morning as the weather began to warm, washing away the frost of Winter. The year was 2016 and there was no more perfect setting. The intense rays of the morning sun broke through the shaded window, softly blanketing Vy as she slept. The radiating light gently woke Chris as he stared in awe. "I could marry the shit out of this girl," he thought.</p>

			<p class="bodytext">As the days passed and turned to weeks, the plan began to take form, a shape of sorts. Vy's birthday was not 6 months away and he knew the perfect offering&mdash;a place known to the world as "Italy". Italy was a fabled and mystical place, known to have the best pasta of all places known to man. With the help of pasta and the mystical lands, Chris knew that there'd be no better place to present than this to present the Stone of Perpetuity.</p>

			<p class="bodytext">Taming the fair maiden was no trivial task. Chris went to his noble friends Tian and Sophia to request aide. He told them of his plan and they responded, "Omg Italy has such good food! Let's gooo!!!" And with that, the negotiations were set and travel arrangements made.</p>

			<p class="bodytext">As Autumn swept away the Summer's heat, Vy's birthday approached. On the glorious day, he presented her with the travel vouchers buried under pug-themed attire. As she reached the bottom, she discovered the gift and wept with joy. "I love wine!" she shouted, as her cry echoed through a thousand ears.</p>

			<p class="bodytext">Meanwhile, Chris had a bigger plan. Acquiring the Stone of Pereptuity required immense planning. Once the rare stone had been acquired, the plan was fixed, the stage was set. He called to Vy's Mother and Father, presenting them with the Stone of Perpetuity, asking for their daughter's hand in marriage.</p>

			<p class="bodytext">As they travelled to Italy, Chris spoke to Tian and Sophia in their native tongue at the moment he was to present her with this grand proposal. As they reached the top of an Italy mountain, looking over to the Alps oif Swiss, he told them that this is the time. They prepared their image capturing devices, as he got down on one knee, taking her hand.</p>
