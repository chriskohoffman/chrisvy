			<h1>Italy / 2017</h1>

			<p class="bodytext">It was a particulary crisp Spring morning as the weather began to warm, melting away the frost of Winter. The year was 2016 and there was a no more perfect setting. The morning sun shone through futile shade, softly blanketing Vy as she slept. The warmth of the light beckoned Chris from his deep slumber, illuminating his heart's true desire. Destiny called to him in a singular thought, "I could marry the shit out of this girl."</p>

			<p class="bodytext">As the days passed and turned to weeks, the plan began to take form, a shape of sorts. Vy's birthday was not 6 months away and he knew the perfect destination&mdash;a mysterious place known to the world as "Italy". Fabled as a mystical land, known to have the best pasta one could find. With the help of pasta and the mystical lands, Chris knew that there'd be no better place than this to present Vy with the Stone of Perpetuity.</p>

Once the rare stone had been acquired, the plan was fixed, the stage set. He called upon Vy's Mother and Father, presenting them with the glorious stone and requesting their daughter's hand in marriage.</p>

			<p class="bodytext">As they travelled to Italy and reached the top of an Italian mountain in Lake Como, Chris knew this was the place. The view was grand&mdash;moutains stretching into infinity, swallowed by the horizon of the light-drenched sky. To the locals, these mountains were known as the Alps of the Swiss. Speaking in their native tongue, he called to Tian and Sophia, letting them know the time was ripe. With a subtle nod, they readied their cameras.</p>

			<p class="bodytext">He sank to a single knee, and took Vy's hand in his...</p>
